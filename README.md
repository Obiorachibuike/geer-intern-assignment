## 🌐 API Routes

* `GET /api/products` – Fetch all products
* `POST /api/products` – Add a new product (expects JSON body)

> **Note**: This is currently using mock data. You can connect to a database like MongoDB, Supabase, etc.

---

## 🧪 Optional Enhancements

* ✅ Add persistent storage (e.g., MongoDB or Firebase)
* 🛒 Add cart functionality
* 🖼 Image upload preview
* 💬 Product reviews or ratings

---

## 📌 Assumptions

* The product `id` is unique and used for detail page routing
* Image URL is validated on input; broken links show a placeholder
* Intersection Observer only runs on the client (disabled on SSR)
* Products are managed in-memory via the mock API for demonstration
